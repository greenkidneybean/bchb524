Results

$ python 11.1.py data.csv R00884
File: data.csv
Gene: R00884

Tumor Group: 1
Mean: -0.9857073170731704
Standard deviation: 0.49566217074478863

Tumor Group: 2
Mean: -1.3325633802816899
Standard deviation: 0.5565115372149642

Tumor Group: All Values
Mean: -1.2055892857142856
Standard deviation: 0.5605238709325446

Method
1. Input data at the command line
  - data file in .csv format, with "TOMOUR" column
  - gene name within file
2. Functions for mean and standard deviation
  - calc_mean - calculates the mean value of an input list of ints
  - calc_stdev - calculates the standard deviation from an input list of ints, uses the math.sqrt() function
  - tumor_grps - function that breaks-down the values by tumor groups and prints the mean and standard deviation

Strengths
- accomplishes the task of calculating the mean and standard deviation of the values for a given gene name within the file
- also reports the group stats as well as the collective stats

Weaknesses
- cannot compute values for multiple genes, just a single gene
- may be more useful if output was formatted as a .csv file
  - then could pipe this script with multiple gene names
- currently no helpful error messages if proper arguments not provided or no gene name in the file
- could also provide additional descriptive stats (median, mode, IQR, etc.)

Tests
- tried calling different gene names in the data.csv file
- tried calling a gene not within the data.csv file 

What I learned
- the more modular the functions the more useful they are in the long-run
- i had forgotten how to calculate the standard deviation, so this was a great review :)
  - also, kinda fun to write math functions from scratch
