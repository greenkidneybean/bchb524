Exercise 17.1

Michael Chambers - 191104

Results
Added try/except statements to the codon_table (codon_table_17.py) and DNASeq (DNASeq_17) modules to improve the functionality of the code by raising helpful errors.

Method
Primarily focused on uses of the dict.get() method to be replaced with try/except statements to raise a helpful error message when a KeyError was raised (searched key was not found in the particular dictionary).

Strengths
Improves the usability and organization of the two modules developed in this class by improving the debugging process for users.

Weaknesses
There are certainly more edge cases that are not addressed by the error messages in these modules, but I think the exception statements that have been built-in will be helpful to future users should they encounter a problem.

Tests
- checked the functionality of any individual functions that were changed
- repeated the output generated by exercise 16.1

What I learned
- I've never been introduced to try/except statements before, this is incredibly useful for custom scripts.
  - improves the usability for others
  - helps highlight what I'm trying to get across in a given function, which is helpful for me to come back to when I haven't been looking at a particular set of code in a while
- I also find it helpful that the exceptions can be raise with particular error types, will be keeping this feature in mind when writing future functions
