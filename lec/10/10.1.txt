Method
1. script requires a direct sequence input (not a file)
2. sequence input is reversed and split into a list of upper case characters
3. the mapping function is used to convert each nucleotide character in the new list to its reverse complement
4. the reverse complement characters are joined together and printed

Strengths
- compact script that returns a list of characters
- compact script (gets the job complete in 6 lines)
- alternative method that uses a list comprehension is commented out, 1 line shorter
- can handle an "N" character, simpley swaps for the same character

Weaknesses
- does not maintain the case of input characters (converts everything to upper case)
- does not call an error if improper sequences are provided in the input
- does not handle an input sequence file

Tests
- different cases of sequence in input
- tested sequences of variable lengths

What I learned
- lambda functions can be helpful for little ditty's to add to a script, quick functions
- nice to write modular functions from previous exercises that can be used for exercises in the future
