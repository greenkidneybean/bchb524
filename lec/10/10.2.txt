Method
1. opens and converts the input sequence file into a string
2. a nucleotide dictionary is created that iterates through the sequence
  - each new character gets a new key
  - if key exists, increases the count by one for that character
3. final nucleotide dictionary is sorted into a descending list by dictionary value
4. print statement iterates through the sorted list

Strengths
- is character agnostic, can handle any characters and will count the number of instances
- does convert sequence to upper case ("A" and "a" would not be distinguished)
- simple code that accomplishes the assigned task

Weaknesses
- does not check for invalid nucleotide characters (but this can also be seen as a plus)
- does not distinguish between upper and lower case characters (would be a nice option to add in the future)
- input must be a sequence file (does not handle direct sequence input)

Tests
- sequences with varying cases (upper and lower mixed)
- sequences that include different characters (N,X, etc)
- input sequence file has gaps and blank lines that are all concatenated together

What I learned
- again, it's turning out to be quite helpful to use snippets from previous scripts, will try to make things as modular as possible in order to incorporate them in future work
- as always, it's tricky to accommodate for edge cases.  This is accomplishing the minimal task, some error checking may be helpful but I kinda like having the flexibility of input characters that this script provides
