Exercise 22.1

Results
$ python 22.py drosoph-results.xml

<alignment data>

Query: gi|17647949|ref|NP_523931.1| signal recognition particle protein 54k [Drosophila melanogaster]
Match: gnl|BL_ORD_ID|49 gi|6325345|ref|NP_015413.1| Srp54p [Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c]
Score: 1126.0
Evalue: 1.04165e-151
Gaps: 18

Method
1. Input blastp output .xml file against the yeast-ribosome database (drosoph-results.xml)
2. Iterate through the alignments in the .xml input file
   - extract the first alignment in the file
   - if the expected (evalue) score is < 1e-5 then add the entry to a dictionary
   - print just the highest match based upon evalue
3. Print the best matching yeast gene with the highest HSP score

Strengths
- Prints off the highest evalue alignments if the evalue is < 1e-5
  - Prints an error message if there aren't any good matches
- Identifies the best match for the yeast ribosome proteins
- Will only report a best match if there is at least 1 good match found in the alignments

Weaknesses
- Does not print all of the alignments, just the highest (but simplifies the output)
- Strictly requires .xml input

Tests
- Tested with the full drosoph-results.xml
- Tested against a shortened query file with 1 protein contained within
- Tested with a query file with no proteins contained within

What I learned
- Much more fun to play with local Blast databases (faster)
- Didn't know about HSP scores and the difference from evalues
