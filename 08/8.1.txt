$ python 8.1.py
Input:    ATGCATTCGTATTTTT
Method 1: AAAAATACGAATGCAT
Method 2: AAAAATACGAATGCAT
Method 3: AAAAATACGAATGCAT
Method 4: AAAAATACGAATGCAT
Method 5: AAAAATACGAATGCAT
Method 6: AAAAATACGAATGCAT

Method
- Method 1: utilize previous functions to reverse sequence and use if statements to generate a reverse complement sequence
- Method 2: utilizes two lists with complement bases located in the corresponding index, uses index number to extract correct complementing base
- Method 3: uses a dictionary with the key being the sequence base and the value being the complement base, uses a for loop to work through the input sequence and extract single bases from the sequence to find the corresponding complement base value in the dictionary
- Method 4: also uses a dictionary with keys being bases in the input sequence and values being the complement base, uses the join attribute of strings to compile a list of complement bases from the reversed input sequence
- Method 5: similar to method 2 but uses two strings rather than two lists, the corresponding complement base is in the same index position in the second string, index is used to extract the correct complement base
- Method 6: a nasty one-liner that generates a reverse complement sequence.  This is mostly based off of method 4 but it is not a function.

Strengths
- found a couple of different ways to use conditional statements, strings, lists, and dictionaries to generate a reverse complement sequence
- found a one-liner solution (but it's gross)
- I especially like method 4, fairly clean and does the job

Weaknesses
- none of these methods will maintain character case variability in an input sequence (e.g. AtG would become CAT and not CaT)
- none of the functions check to see if the input characters are valid (should only accept a,c,t, and g)
  - would be slick if it also accepted wildcard/mixed nucleotides (R=A,G; V=A,C,G; etc.)
- cannot handle spaces in the sequence

Tests
- used upper and lower case sequences
- tried sequences that do not contain ACGT characters - raises KeyError
- tried sequence with spaces in it - raises KeyError
  - this could be handled by forcing the input sequence through: "".join(seq.upper().split())

What I learned
- still difficult to think-of and catch edge cases, so many different ways input could be provided
  - maybe would be best to raise a simple error that the input is not correct
- found a way to cram everything into a single line, but it doesn't look all that Pythonic
- was fun finding new ways to use different data types
  - could certainly exploit more functions (zip, enumerate) to leverage datatypes and avoid writing nested loops
