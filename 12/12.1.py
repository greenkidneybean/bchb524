0.  Read through and try the examples from Chapters 2-5 of BioPython's Tutorial.
1a. Download human proteins from RefSeq and compute amino-acid frequencies for the (RefSeq) human proteome.
Which amino-acid occurs the most? The least?
Hint: access RefSeq human proteins in human.protein.fasta.gz from the course data-folder.
1b. Download human proteins from SwissProt and compute amino-acid frequencies for the SwissProt human proteome.
Which amino-acid occurs the most? The least?
Hint: access SwissProt human proteins from 	http://www.uniprot.org/downloads -> “Taxonomic divisions”
1c. How similar are the human amino-acid frequencies of in RefSeq and SwissProt?
