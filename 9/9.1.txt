Method
1. opens input codon table file and converts to a codon dictionary
2. opens sequence input file and breaks-down to a sequence without spaces
3. incorporates 4 functions to convert the sequence to an aa sequence for each of the 6 open reading frames
  - rev_comp - previous function that simply generates a reverse complement of the input sequence
  - check_wiggle - if an "N" is identified in the third position of a given codon, that n is replaced with A,C,T, or G and places the encoding AA in a new dictionary.  A set of the values in that dictionary are called and if that set is of length one then the encoding AA is returned, otherwise an "X" is returned
  - check_codon - looks through the generated codons dictionary and returns the appropriate aa.  If that aa is not found then it returns "X"
  - translate_seq - final function that pulls all three previous functions together to translate the input sequence

Strengths
- is able to accommodate for wiggle if "N" is in the third position
- can use different codon tables, user can choose which table they'd like to use
- I think the output is simple yet sufficient to inform the user

Weaknesses
- cannot handle multiple sequences in a given file, just one
- would be nice to not require a codon table
- script does not raise a helpful error if a faulty character is found that cannot be translated

Tests
- sequences with varying cases (upper, lower, mixed)
- sequences that include "N" in various positions
- input sequence file has gaps and blank lines that are all concatenated together

What I learned
- this was a tricky exercise, but a great challenge
- pulled a lot of previous code together, fun to use
- I definitely feel like I could and should simplify this script, but it does work
